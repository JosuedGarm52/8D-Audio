# binary_audio  
======  

The inspiration for this project came from a series of YouTube videos I was
shown, called [8D Audio](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrRpYEytIHGyDgNWO6VbHlQ/videos "Check it out!").  
Despite the unconventional name, I thought this was pretty neat, so I have decided to make a series of signal processing methods to make any song "8D Audio".

## Getting Started  
At this point, the only dependancy is [Librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/index.html). You can download using pip,  
`pip install librosa`  
The python file assumes you have the following directories  
...* ./binary_audio/sample_audio
...* ./binary_audio/sample_output
